# AccessLevel
In many computer systems and networks, different users are
granted different levels of access to different resources.
In this case, you are given a int[] rights, indicating the
privilege level of each user to use some system resource.
You are also given a int minPermission, which is the
minimum permission a user must have to use this resource.
A String indicating which users can and
cannot access this resource is returned. Each character in the return
value corresponds to the element of users with the same
index. 'A' indicates the user is allowed access, while 'D'
indicates the user is denied access
